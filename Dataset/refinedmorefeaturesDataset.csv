amit shah shah still diaperwearing amateur game pawar veteran sharad pawar co managed split senabjp alliance although alliance always rocky pawar co managed split natural alliance bjp shiv sena borne shared hindutva idealogy simultaneously managing form alliance bitter rivals prevent bjp forming government seems super obvious impressive considering fact bjp netted amount votes election exposed hypocrisy bjp bjp always run platform stated party government corrupt unlike opposition multiple huge corruption scandals one major reasons saga ajit pawar lets face never seriously splitting ncp ploy sharad pawar managed expose corrupt nature bjp public manner saved ajit pawar jail cherry top pawar co possibly stinging thing happen bjp whole saga pawar managed expose corruption bjp also managed save nephew consequences corruption using enemy deliverertool salvationnow great dandy pawar ncp shiv sena congress mean us observers voters maharashtra well conclusions ended whole saga democracy

survival sena got moment struck right time pawar might helped mostly uddhavs awfully looks like publics choice one bjp wins parties keep integrity public loses big time bjp reigns supreme bjp loses parties give away integrity public loses little less bjp invulnerability breaks given fucked leveraging justice political tool bjp used accusations ajit pawar leverage seems option better long run one thing certain im never going vote indian election bother cast vote ultimately traded power brokers like part still says even though lost government one one pick pieces apart alliances well yeah governors neutral law fuck casealso president neutral law yet another puppet hands bjp ideology never mattered theyd sell mothers meant theyd get power long new alliancetrio collapse great post well summarisedyou also mention governor imposed presidents rule time given ncp prove majority elapsed another example bjp manipulated neutral institutions benefit hold horses though picture baaki hai

impact gst invoicing thus revenue profit organizations operating india exploring one factors impacting economy right,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,tldrbecause gst organizations bill clients state involved gst norms gst required one bill means

numerous requirementsmy objective highlight major roadblock many business folks encountered due gst feel aspect playing big role slowdown time left largely unexplored till grassroot nature problem people higher dont encounter directly anyone doesnt encounter wouldnt understand gravity problem aka reporters etc reiterate trying debate improvements vat merely highlight side gst hindering revenue profit thus businesslets start basic concepts first invoicing act giving bill products services utilized customer people simple receipt end meal instance checkout counter clothing store clothes youve purchased bill given cleaning service cleaning homesbut organization invoice means collect money client anything sold client generate invoice products deliveredservices rendered invoice also tax details gst number billing address registered address shipping address list items need paid applicable tax cgst igst sgst payment due date authorized signaturesan invoice means collect cash client without proper invoice cash cannot collected problem starts since proper invoice gives lot ground client delay payment process invoicing invoicing function organization product delivered services rendered sometimes delivered invoicing triggered meaning bill generated money collected client usually done erp like sap oracle invoice reaches collections department collection manager submits invoice client verification payment collection managers front line people tasked bringing money organization one important people running business performance impacts cash flow organizationthey normally tagged accounts aka clients one collection manager could handling anywhere one client thousands depending nature size clientsonce client verifies invoice money transferred selling

invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistakes happen real life one common things face mistakes happened gst well happen multiples really cant expect people make mistakes always efficiency goes multiple times effort required fix mistakesc missing gst isnt necessary companies gst registration every state tata motors might registered office states example ie wont gst number provide declaration pepperfry saying dont gst number two states pepperfry able give invoice payment money delayed till getting declaration experience takes long time tata motors says arent able claim input tax credit state thats like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash cannot survive could valued billion dollars dont cash pay employees shut kingfisher couldnt pay employees interest vendors didnt cash left jet doesnt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggling pay things dont cashthus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company companies people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought companybecause decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash pregst cash collected days would taking say days collection managers efficiency gone downand tiny delays add incorrect gst add another days cash collected missing gst add days etcthis two outcomesfirstly pepperfry earlier predicted theyll get money days receiving days means lakhs need th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since days coming another weeks dip reserves dayssecondly money lost value lakhs end days since time passed lost value due time value money couldve generated interest couldve invested delayed hence value lost loss pepperfryto summarize gst delayed payment cycle company takes longer collect amount money used gst introduced money takes longer come takes longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted profit profit made deal varies company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry made profit deal ie lakhs due following factors profit get impacteda payment cycle delayed theyre collecting profit longer duration collect lakhs start making profit could say theyve collected invoices remaining give profit basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed means profit made deal lost value pregst lakhs itll less lakhs value due time value money efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone downb invoices process always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash wont collected invoice amount get reduced profit invoice hasnt gotten processed lakhs profit less say lakhs lakhs collected deal pepperfry actually make loss dealthe biggest culprits psus like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted wont pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons many businesses dont sell psus reason profits cash get stuck business themthis different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chances wont make amount profitthus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impactedin conclusion ramblings
