#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during time of crisis. 

Its not that they are providing pothole free roads, swift public transport, education or healthcare for that tax. Fine - Don't provide all these basic services but at least the government should not come with a begging bowl during each crisis!

 According to ICMR our current testing strategy is: 

* All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days:

* All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

* All symptomatic health care workers.

* All hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath).

* Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.

It’s crystal clear that we’ve a very restrictive testing criteria that only tests NRIs, foreigners and people who’re in direct with these people, including medical staffs. We are completely masking the community transmission of corona virus, since people who were directly in contact with those people might have come in contact with hundreds of other people. 

An example of this would be recent Nizamuddin Dargah and Shradhdha ceremony incidents where government only quarantined only those people who were directly involved in the events but those who attended these event might have further spread the virus to several other people, Several thousands or way more to be specific. 

One of the attendee of Jamat was a grocery shopkeeper in my uncle’s town, he was recently taken into custody. So, he alone might have come in contact with thousands of people before he was taken into custody. 

Also, last week 2 people died from corona virus in Dharavi slum, where millions of people are jam-packed in a tiny area, they use the same water-taps and toilets, apparently the government only tested 70 people in that slum and 15 tested positive. Which is no-where near the actual numbers, those 15 people might have come in contact with several hundreds or thousands of people in their own slum. 

If this goes on, I believe we’ll completely ignore the community transmission and the fact that “asymptomatic carries” of corona virus are the biggest cause of cases increasing exponentially in developed countries. 

I don’t think, Kerala flattening the curve is something to be happy about (yet). Since, they’ve started rapid testings to check community transmission I believe that might give us a clearer picture of the situation.",Coronavirus

I have been in home isolation for a while and today went out to buy groceries and random food products. To my surprise some shopkeepers (not many) are selling basic items like biscuits, maggi, lays, etc at price higher than MRP. The price increase is about Rs.4 to Rs.6, which is not much but I don't like the fact that they are taking advantage of the crises and people needs. 

These items not necessarily comes under essential goods but I think its still not right. When I ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies. 

So here are my questions:

* Where to complain about this?
* Should I wait for pandemic to settle down first?

Many of those you browsed Reddit India yesterday saw my post asking for help from anyone who's currently able to perform International Transaction, i needed help to pay for my certification  course as i learned that my Card is not valid for International use. few approached me but one person actually did it for me and after he got to know that i am a student he did it for free.

I was trying to connect with him to get his bank account details so that i can pay him back but he replied to me with this message. I am very thankful that he did this for me and its good to know that there is still something positive in the world considering current circumstances.

I fully condemn the tablighi Incident, however i do not subscribe to the hatred spewed against ALL Indian Muslims based on that incident. I welcome criminal proceedings against the organizers of tablighi Jamaat who flouted the law, but please do not hold ALL Muslims responsible for the actions of a select few.

Also i think these religious gatherings are not limited only to a single community

All religious gatherings need to be highlighted by the media, if at least to educate the locals and to put pressure on local governments into taking precautionary measures and containment measure to stop the spread of Corona virus.

LIST OF HINDU GATHERINGS POST TABLIGHI JAMAAT CONGREGATION :

(pulled from a tweet ...so did not individually check the numbers )

&#x200B;

EDIT : What happened After the Tablighi Jamaat was criminal .....i.e the maulvi's & some participants not co-operating with Indian authorities

Although there were larger gatherings of Hindu's as well ...i do not think they have (luckily, as yet) spread the virus. Why? because there is no way the virus would not have been detected and linked to some of them cause devotees (60,000) come from across India.

Yogi was and will always be a religious bigot and an idiot. and Yes there were foreigners in some of the gatherings too (ISCON)

However, targeting one community and calling it corona Jihad or whatever is wrong.

I mean i feel sick whenever i browse the other sub-reddit ....its just vile hatred spewed against the minority community in 80% of the posts! thank god it s not a reflection of India or Indians views (i hope)",Coronavirus

First we wash them with a solution of water and baking soda/salt and then keep them to dry in the sun for an hour or two. And then the person who went out to get the stuff(which is mostly me) has to immediately take a bath and wash the clothes as well.

This virus outbreak is causing a lot of problems for all hospitals. People who don't really require it are hoarding masks and other medicines. This has caused a grave problem as protective masks which you could buy for Rs.2.5 6 months ago are now being sold for ten times their price. This is morally wrong, unethical but sadly it is not illegal in [India](https://indiacorplaw.in/2020/03/price-gouging-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-an-analysis-of-the-regulatory-strategies.html) . This affects the people in the medical field the most as they are the ones who depend on these products the most.

All doctors are risking their lives by treating patients during this pandemic and they get screwed by the public. One day everyone was clapping which was originally planned as a gesture of appreciation for doctors and nurses. The next day we get news about [stone pelting](https://english.jagran.com/india/coronavirus-outbreak-health-officials-attacked-in-indore-during-covid19-patient-tracking-two-injured-watch-10010285) which had happened on doctors .Majority of the people of these country always had a certain hatred for doctors and the current situation would only intensify their hate towards them.

Most medical shops seemed to have closed down but in reality they have hijacked the cost of all the medications to 10-20 times their original price and are selling these essential supplies secretly. This is all really messed up that some people are trying (and succeeding) to profit  off of this.

When the doctors ask the government for help I think the government laughs at them. When there is an acute shortage of PPE, [the government has exported them to Serbia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/even-as-docs-use-raincoats-india-exports-suits-to-serbia/articleshow/74957518.cms).

Also the Supreme Court decided that all private facilities capable of doing so must [test suspected carriers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-orders-free-coronavirus-testing-at-private-labs-1664802-2020-04-08) of the coronavirus free of charge. I don't think once this disease is contained that the government has the slightest intention of reimbursing the labs. Currently, the labs are supposed to test the patients for free and incur the loss as they themselves have to purchase the testing kits. I don't think these people who decided this understand how business/economy works.

I really hope something is done about ALL the things I have talked about. I honestly hope that the problems highlighted above are dealt with. Things are going to get worse before they get better.

1. Age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

So, we are passed on from Generations the books like Gita, Bible, and Quran and many others. And people telling it from so long. The story of Ram and Krishna passed on through ages. It’s true or not, it does not matter. It was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. It’s worth considering. And no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. Exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

So, there are times people experience, so-called God bliss. By that, I mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. And after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

I think this happens with most of the people around. And that is how I think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. It’s like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

Its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. It is the force of probability.

And yeah, you may think it doesn’t happen with everyone, its probability, It happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in God. It’s because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. So, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some God. Maybe there is…

3. You cannot prove something, that doesn’t exist:

So, a great philosopher. I don’t remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. You can say yes, it exists. Why?

Because if God exists, you are right. And if he doesn’t exist, then you can never prove something that doesn’t exist. Like if I say, I am seeing a God, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. You will say it does not. But in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. You cannot prove negativity. You cannot prove things that don’t exist. You can only prove things that exist.",Non-Political

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient.

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF’s Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today’s hearing which happened via video conferencing.

edit. answer by TintinQuarantino420 is very comprehensive
> There are two phases for Swiggy
1.) Before order is accepted by the restaurant : If the customer cancels before that, then the customer gets the complete refund. Restaurant doesn't get paid anything.
2.) After the order is accepted by the restaurant : Customer will get only x% of amount as refund the remaining (100-x)% is given to the restaurant after swiggy commission
3.) Outlier cases : Customer has fought for a genuine reason (order too late etc) then comes 2 cases again
a.) Restaurant has marked food ready but delay is from delivery partner assignment:(this will apply to the case you mentioned, but delivery partner not being available is an almost impossible case)
Swiggy bears the complete cost of cancellation
b.) Restaurant is delaying food prep :
Restaurant bears the canceling charges given as refund to the customer.
If restaurants mark food ready without it being ready, a common pattern of cases will result in a penalty on the restaurant.
If, there is something different about food prep time compared to what historical data suggests about the restaurant then it will be investigated with the restaurant needing to bear cost unless it can genuinely prove otherwise. This is because delivery partner assignment has food prep time as a factor in deciding when and who to assign",AskIndia

During summers apartments get quite hot during the daytime, and night time temps are typically 5-10 degrees lower. At night (around 11pm-midnight) the indoor temp is often 5 degrees or more higher than the outdoor temp. Opening windows to promote air exchange is a rather slow process and also results in dust coming in, hence we end up running an AC for 20-30 min to cool just one room.

Instead, is it practical to have a high volume intake fan attached to a window, with a HEPA filter. Run this intake fan for a few minutes to flush out the air inside the room with fresh air from outside through the filter. This would instantly cool the room to the outside temp, and also instead of running an AC consuming 1000-1500W, the initial reduction would come from a fan consuming 100 watts or so.

155,fxb9zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/,"Finance Basics – Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance","Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",Business/Finance

157,fxpcir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxpcir/is_this_a_good_deal/,Is this a good deal?,"Hey guys.
Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest. 

Please help out a brother in need! 

Cheers and stay safe!",Business/Finance

Basically I'm having a crisis .... 

I'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... Scary things .....

It started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I'm not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

That escalated to ""maybe I am actually a criminal"" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I'm an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I'm a criminal... I'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

Now the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

And that I'd lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I'm getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary 

Especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

Most of my friends are online and I'm in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven't contacted them ..... And I've been scared shitless ...... 

Many of the other things I'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as ""warnings"" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It's so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

I even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... 

Because of which I'm unable to let my guard down ....

And it's really scaring me ......

Even if most relegions might not have hell ... I'm scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It's really scary and ruining my health

I'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",Non-Political

I cannot get my head around people’s perceived notions about democracy, rights, and political affiliations.

Rather than holding the government accountable, people are cheering for the subpar measures during this epidemic. We are still not testing enough people to know the actual count. Due to the lack of resources, only people with travel history/confirmed contact are being prioritized. Social distancing is neither being followed or enforced. Stranded migrants, police brutality, economic crises are rarely mentioned in the news. Fake news continues to spread like wildfire long before it is dispelled.

While these are the pressing issues, the media has made it a BJP vs Congress tirade. TV debates are presented by loudmouths that only feed delusions. Supporters on both sides blame the other first chance they get. How exactly do you make them understand that accountability matters and it is an utter disservice to the nation to follow a party blindly?

Parties have dug their claws deep inside peoples’ minds through social media and WhatsApp. How exactly can we create political awareness in the public so that the govt knows it will be held accountable? Can there be any technological solution? Does it have to be a community effort? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

Joined fresh out of a good college at okay salary (around 14 LPA total compensation). Never got a chance to interview for Amazon in college so took a chance and interviewed and got selected(the interview wasn't very difficult and I didn't do very well in the difficult round)

Pros:
The increment I am getting in my current compensation is huge (9+ lakh, this includes bonus as well with base around 16), not counting the stocks
I am also getting a brand name for my resume
Work on higher scale. Also, current company has lots of tech debt and not a very clear plan for future whereas Amazon's team looks good
Current company is not growing very fast and although we have been assured no layoffs due to corona, I don't exactly trust the senior management
I will have better opportunities ( non tech as well) at amazon

Cons:
Leaving so early makes me look greedy for future employers

I love the culture at my current team ( no on-call, friendly people but not exceptionally knowledgeable)

I work much more efficiently (for 12 hrs daily currently and like it) and am very deadline oriented but in a friendly environment where there's not much anxiety about getting fired which I believe is opposite of Amazon's culture

With this high salary there would surely be higher expectations as fresh grads who will join with me will be getting 20% less base than me so what if I can't get the job done and I won't even be able to leave in case things don't work out as I already would have left current company in 4-5 months

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

We(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.
We both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.


A brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)


If she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

I asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.

It certainly is a huge crisis but it also comes with a few opportunities which the various government departments that are not busy with COVID-19 can handle like the PWD, Roads and Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation, etc.

I think it would be a great time to fix infrastructure in most cities, in buildings that are heavily used throughout the day, in bridges and roads that require critical maintenance and also in heritage sites which are overwhelmed with visitors but need maintenance. The governments should utilize this opportunity to hire laborers and provide them with food and accommodation along with generous rates for the work and ensure proper safety from the corona crisis.

This way when the cities are back up and running, much of those infrastructure projects that forces roads to be closed either totally or partially could be avoided and a lot of the traffic caused by jams can also be avoided.

Stranded migrants, police brutality, economic crises are rarely mentioned in the news. Fake news continues to spread like wildfire long before it is dispelled. 

While these are the pressing issues, the media has made it a BJP vs Congress tirade. TV debates are presented by loudmouths that only feed delusions. Supporters on both sides blame the other first chance they get. How exactly do you make them understand that accountability matters and it is an utter disservice to the nation to follow a party blindly?

And you have to step out to get essentials, or even delivery someday.


The hang Sanitizer market has recovered somewhat, and you can get one from time to time in chain pharmacies. But if you don't have, and worried about going to market, then carry your aftershave with you.


Now, there are three caveats:


1. Your aftershave needs to contain alcohol. How to know? If it burns your skin like magma, post shaving, it has alcohol. Most commerical aftershaves have over 60% alocohol easily. But do read the label. Lotions will not work.


2. You hands gonna smell really strongly for a few hours. Reconsider this if you have to eat or pick up veggies immediately. Unless, after returning home, you wash it with soap and water.


3. Cost. Aftershaves are far costlier than most hand sanitizers. But then again, this is an one off scenario.. can't hurt.",Coronavirus

Edit:

Apparently I'm wrong. That's not how the fatality rate is calculated. 

>In epidemiology, a case fatality rate (CFR) — sometimes called case fatality risk — is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a certain period of time

For such a rapidly spreading disease CFR doesn't show us a good enough picture because most of the people who have diagnosed still haven't completed their course yet. 

So, It seems we'll know the actual fatality rate only after the pandemic is over.


|Country|Total Recovered|Total Deaths|Fatality Rate(%)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|S. Korea|6,776|200|2.86|
|Germany|36,081|2,096|5.4|
|Iran|27,039|3,993|12.8|
|Italy|24,392|17,127|41.25|
|India|468|164|25.6|
|USA|21,815|12,988|37.3|


The high fatality rate of Italy can be attributed to the high number of cases but in India, the currently there aren't many cases yet we have such a high fatality rate. 

Can anyone explain this?

1. what kind of jobs an MBA with Finance can get ? as a fresher ?
2. what is your experience with MBA with Finance ? is it hard ? complex ?
3. what is your current job ? what kind of tasks you perform at work ? what kind of software you use for that ?
4. is Quickbooks or Xero  necessary ?
5. do i really need to know everything about accounting standards and accounting laws as well as methods to qualify for the jobs ?
6. do you use Software for your Day-to-day work ? if yes, what are those software ?
7. any advice for MBA students who are looking for this path but are average in accounting but very good with numbers, statistics and ratios ?

your answers will greatly influence hundreds of Students who are currently having same dilemma  and cant decide if it's Right major for them or not.

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

And no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.",AskIndia

I wanted to ask an important question, which no one seems to be asking. If you have basic economics knowledge, you’d know every country has a reserve fund. I remember a RTI disclosed sometime back that India has none.

Where is it? Why is the government instead of giving financial support to people, asking for donations in the PM cares fund?

Almost every country’s government is giving money to people. In Canada, people are getting $2,000 per month. US employment pays out $1,200 per month. Same in EU..

Considering our PM and FM have been boasting so much about India being financially stable, where is the stability?

And please, if you are going to reply about the relief package announcement by Modi, don’t bother. That fund has not been deployed and has not reached the concerned people.

Note: they do not specify what services will stop after the plan expires.

I'm confused because this is a local number and I thought the IR pack I used was just to charge his phone with IR facilitates. So because now that he is back in India, I thought that even if that expires, his number and the local services it comes with should still work...right?

Side note (which I am not sure is relevant): When he went abroad, even though his number was charged, IR facilities were not working and a customer care person explained that he would have to charge his number with some other plan of Rs. 400-500 to get the pack to work. I'm not sure if this is how IR really works.

Can someone explain what exactly will happen if he does not recharge? Is it that all services will stop entirely, or only IR facilities? Will he still get incoming calls, even from abroad, or will even that be cut? Thanks in advance.",AskIndia

So I am a high school student who lives in west bengal. My elder  brother works for a paper press company . I dont want to name the company but it presses the qustion papers for West Bengal board. 

So let's get to the point. Last night, around 11:22 pm my brother's boss called him and told him that  he has to go to work from tomorrow (which is today) for 4 days because of some production that is on hold for the lockdown. When my brother said he cannot go because he has a daughter and don't want to get her infected through him. His boss told him that he has to go to work otherwise he will lose his job. Boss said that he is going to send a car for him(don't think my brother is on a high rank) . But ,he wont be alone. Five of his co workers were also ordered to go to work. So, the six of them will go in a car in which way the practice of social distancing is not happening. 

My brother with a fear in his heart , went to work today at 8:30 am . The reason he decided to go to work is because he has EMIs of two phones pending and a debt from his friend to clear(his friend being generous told him to give back the money after this lockdown). 

I am asking u guys tell others about this because this is happening not only to my brother but to many other workers across India.",Coronavirus

I know it's because of the overload in internet traffic due to the nationwide lockdown, and I'm not complaining about that. I use a 2.4 GHz router, it's practically ancient at this point, but I never really felt the need to change, and I'm regretting that decision now. The speeds had gotten really slow lately and I was getting disconnected every five minutes.

But then, all of a sudden, the internet went out. Poof. Gone. There was a solid red light in my router, instead of green. Then it would switch back and forth between a red light and no light at all. I figured it was because I hadn't paid my bills for March owing to the COVID-19 scare, it sorta slipped my mind. So two days back, I paid my bills via Amazon, for BOTH March and April altogether, and the Internet still hasn't returned. I tried tweaking around with the DNS settings, resetting my router, checking the ADSL splitter and cables, so far, nothing's worked. I tried calling the BSNL Broadband Customer Service . No one's picked up. Even though I've heard that telecom companies are supposed to stay open amidst the lockdown.

I'm seriously pissed at BSNL right now. I've had to use mobile hotspots these past few days, and its really inconvenient.

Living in Silchar, Assam, I don't really have much choice with high-speed FITH connections, (aside from JioFiber, I guess?), and I've got a soft spot for BSNL too, but this is getting on my nerves. Either give me my Internet back, or give me my money back.

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things. FML.",AskIndia

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It’s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It’s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt. 

“For many years India has taken advantage of the US in terms of trade” - On trade

“If they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the US there maybe be retaliation, off course there would be retaliation” - On Hydrochloroquine

“And we're supposed to say, 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan” - On India’s role in Afghanistan

“ Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan” - On Namaste Trump In Ahmedabad

“Tariff King"" - On India’s local industries 

While the barrage of pettiness and hate, that is reserved for countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey and others in India’s more immediate neighborhood, is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of India, somehow this strong and aggressive Hindu-nationalist government almost always just cowers down to the US and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests. And it’s not as if they do it begrudgingly, their supporters continue to revere and look at the White House as a friend and well wisher.",Politics

* India’s current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve. May sources also claimed India will peak the epidemic around April first week, which is far from truth. But according to speculations from artificial intelligence, India will peak during June-July..",AskIndia

419,fwhtmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwhtmr/rant_the_whatsapp_admin_thing/,Rant : The WhatsApp Admin thing,"First of all, I may be terribly wrong in many things and I will gladly accept criticism.

The WhatsApp Admin arrest thing feels like the worst case of technological illiteracy. 

Almost a year ago, someone I know made a simple group for discussing before exams. Everyone used their contacts and added people from everywhere and it was really great and helpful. Fast forward to a night before exam, everyone was stressed and the group was silent since everyone was busy studying. In these dark times, the guys who are the most Vella are awake.

One of the guys shared a meme about a Historical Figure and some guys got butthurt as it affected their class or something, shared group link with 20 others, abused the shit out of that guy and it went on and on. 

The Admin had his phone shut due to highly obvious reasons, came online 3 hours later and removed those new people,  and the guy who shared the meme who was sorry about it, told everyone that this group ain't for this, and deleted it as well but it was too late.

The People had some ties up and shared screenshot with the police. They got their hands on the person who shared the meme and then the admin who has absolutely no part in this at all. And a huge police case with tons of cash.

Looking at the current situation every group is like the Admin should be responsible for what happens on group and what not. I heard of cases where group admins are arrested, like 20 of them as well, just because some dumb forward was on their group.

**Why exactly is this dumb?**

WhatsApp does not provide any rights to a Group Admin. Apart from Adding and Removing people. 

When a person is removed they can still see the group members and the chats after they are deleted.

A person who is deleted can still have group link and use it to add others untill it's revoked

A Group can have around 40 Admins from any place in India or other. So according to the law or whatever is said, all of those 40 Admins can be held accountable.

Admins are usually a joke in WhatsApp groups. Barely anyone actually respects them.


These issues are really solved in Discord and Telegram where there are very real rights provided to a Moderator or an Admin. And I think even Facebook Group Admins have more rights but this is clearly dumb. I have even heard that some people purposely send messages which can be harmful for a Group or its Admin so that they would be held accountable, while some have even sent messages, and left the group to mentally hurt the Admin. 


And I guess that's the rant. There is no real solution to it, even though a better app exists, no one's going to switch to it be ause some *WhatsApp Forwards* do a fantastic job of *informing people* that these Apps are by some Rival Countries or dumb shit like that.",Politics

I can think of only two possible scenarios of why they could do it.

1. The media has completely sold itself and its morals down the drains and is doing it for money and the media channel owners want to become rich.

2. The media has done something wrong that the current government has caught a hold of. Due to which, the government is forcing them to do it in order to avoid prison.

My inclination is more towards the second possibility since I think people are still humans in the end and no one would actively do what the Indian media is doing.

True, there is still a lot of bad things happening, but the big picture is gradually getting better.

In the context of India, there are a few parameters I considered that show the growth of the society - 

1. Population - Contrary to the popular belief, our population growth has in fact slowed down to almost half it growth rate from previous years.
2. Fertility Rate - Our average fertility rate is lower than the world average! We started from \~6 children per woman after independence and have gone down to \~2.1. The world average is 2.4.
3. Life expectancy - Our life expectancy is improving at a rate almost 2x the world average.
4. Secondary school enrolment for girls - Compared to the world average growth of 1.7%, India's rate of enrolment has been increasing at \~3.5x of that for the last 20 years!

Advocate Prashant Bhushan tells the Court that lakhs of migrant workers are placed in shelter homes and this will make Social Distancing difficult; adds that if one person contracts the virus, it puts everyone in the shelter home at risk. ""They should be allowed to go home""

Bhushan says wages should be released because the migrant workers rely on wages for their meals. CJI SA Bobde asks why wages are required when meals are being provided by the govt. Bhushan points out meals given in shelter homes; not all migrant workers are in shelters

Bhushan adds that workers also need money to send it back home to their families that rely on this money. SG Tushar Mehta says that the government is on top of the situation and looking into all the complaints received; the helpline set up is being monitored constantly

CJI Bobde asks how can it be said that the government is not doing much without looking at the status report filed by the Centre. Bhushan says the orders passed by the govt concern provision of food in shelters and landlords not charging rent; says they are unimplementable

CJI Bobde says Court not inclined to interfere with the Government's decisions for the coming few days; says Court cannot take a getter policy decision at this stage.

Supreme Court to hear the matter again on Monday, April 13. Prashant Bhushan given time till then to peruse the status report filed by the Centre on the issue of migrant workers.

A Red pill for all the intolerant,bigoted Indians who are insidiously targeting religious minority directly and indirectly against the secular spirit of our constitution.

The language used in the post mentioned in one of the prominent subreddit relating to India is filled with deceitful, fraudulent, fictitious material which can be valued as malicious subjective personal opinion, having full slandering and negligible facts.

The accusations are based on the rumours circulating on WhatsApp. This itself can prove no credibility and unreliability of source of the post.Most of the viral videos where Muslims doing all criminal activities are have been proved fictitious, google and you will get. Read twitter and trust worthy newspapers. No doubts some of fringe elements among Muslims have misbehaved but is the correct deduction for the general Muslims? Are you that irrational and stupid?Sticking to the COVID-19 disease, and the alleged spread of corona virus by ""Muslims"" in India. This is a fact that a group of people have attended a religious congregation which is related to propagation Islamic religion in India, totally allowed under Art. 25 of our Constitution for all religions. The fact,approved and proven by the Govt. that this congregation has lead to become one of the instrumental factors in spread of the virus. This fact is not disputed, and its true. It a setback to India's fight against the virus. These people should co-operate with medical fraternity and district administration now. Lesson learned.

Now, Are you gonna now count, the number of positive COVID-19 cases on basis of religion? Is that the society we want to live in? and guess what, Muslims wont be leading the figures.

But the provocatory language and the malafide intent, to show superiority over the least educated, poorest community in India. Does one get a hard on from squishing the weak? Is that one's upbringing. Does this make the speaker any better than the weak? if Yes, Guess what, YOU are insecure and emotionally weaker.

Is this the fraternity and unity of our country? Read the preamble of our Constitution.

Does anyone think, by blaming and insulting, making derogatory comments against Muslim community makes you any better?

Should not we as egalitarians support, help, inform and educate the backward community? Will witch hunting and blood-lust do any good?

Are you doing any help by forwarding the hateful messages on social media? This is to all the hate monger irrespective of your religion.

By equating a religion to a cult, such immature analogy will make all religion a cult. The difference between a religion and cult is what society thinks is unusual. It is left to the society to decide, not by majoritarianism. Sorry, sheer number cannot decide what is correct and not correct.

On one hand lecturing canny advice and other hand, mischievously mockery of stereotypical physical attributed of an Muslim. Be specific, dont try to fool the redditors here by your veil of ""advice"". We are smarter than that. The post's colourable rant exhorts hate and poison. Grow a pair of balls to say it straight.

Alas, the mortality of our lives.We are grateful to stand on the ""shoulders of giants"". Nations can be selfish but people aren't. We are social beings, its the co-operation which has build and will build our long term future not childish competition and selfishness. I urge the sensible redditors to resist such people. All the fringe elements of all religion, Remember, Yours hate speeches serve no purpose, listen and observe the harmony of the society.

One of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. Several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. I am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking India as a case.

Some back of the envelope calculation:

Cost of a test: upto 60$ (in India)
Doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

This sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. So, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. And there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

There can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. I am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown. Basically, pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future.

PS1: Note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly (say an order of magnitude) if we scale up.

PS: I would also go further and say that we should make all international passengers who arrive get this done a few days after arrival (and make them pay for it)",Policy/Economy

\#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require same level of lockdown throughout the country?

\#5: Bonus Question: How are people still getting infected if everyone is locked at home?",Coronavirus

Retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. This means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SALARY while acting like caring, charitable employers.

And don't even talk about the CEO forgoing an entire year of his salary. When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap PR bullshit. And let's not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.

Property ads on a billboard in the outskirts of Pune will feature a Caucasian couple with their children & dog(s).

Internet Service Providers in Mumbai will feature a light skinned African woman with a regulation sized afro in a business formal outfit, posing with a folder and flashing a million dollar smile & a thumbs up.

Nationalized banks's car loan advertisement will have a white guy in a European sedan.

A tiny 3 seater men's hair saloon which has a headshot Zayn Malik from 2013 posing with a purple suit, in Hyderabad. An absolutely random white model with a blonde hairstyle from 2079 stares at you on the other side of the flex board.

IT companies will have their email headers, policy mails, announcements feature a group of well manicured, well groomed ""diverse"" young executives all huddled in a glass conference room looking at an older white explaining some random shit on a white presentation board.

An electronics store in Ahmedabad with a saucy looking brunette, distinctly European woman in a red top and a grey skirt talking on her mobile phone. 

A cute white kid with beach blonde hair in oversized glasses and a book in his hand - used for advertising a new school in Ulhasnagar - and some fancy title about aspiring to be a interplanetary dietician.

Even pet stores will have a button nosed, blonde girl with two ponytail running behind a golden retriever in their flex board.

And how can we forget the tuition classes \ computer class adverts & pamphlets & brochures which have the whole high school stereotype clique posing with bags & large books - one girl in glasses, a white guy in a green tee shirt, the athletic looking jock who's almost always African, an adorable Asian girl in a chic jacket - among others.

Pubs, Hotels, Cafes & Restaurants are almost always the worst offenders with their Blond-Guy-and-Blond-Girl-partying-with-green-disco-lights-in-the-back; one token black guy with a metallic coloured shirt grooving; black girl sipping a coffee in front of a laptop, kid eating a hamburger imagery rehashed across the damn length & breadth of the country.

It took years before even our airports started featuring explicitly Indian models (but in OTT traditional, regional outfits) for general directions & imagery. And banks too.

And even in this - we don't leave behind our inherent racism - light skinned African men & women are cool - but that's the extreme end of our diversity. No overtly Muslim women wearing headscarves \ hijabs, no men with skull caps at all. 

Beards are always like a hipster's from Milwaukee or a Swedish business man's - but never like Rajdeep or Salim. 

Even the banyan advertisements feature our Bollywood stars posing with Bavarian looking models in an MS Paint gradient metallic blue \ grey background.

i understand we thrive with the free use material & basic Google search stock images - but why are we still not using Indian models & faces to sell Indian products.

Dark skinned Indians, East Indians are never even ***considered*** for representation - let alone headline these ad campaigns.

I came out to my parents two years ago. I repent that I didn’t do it any sooner. That’s a different story related to internalised homophobia and bearing extreme shame inside. I used to constantly contemplate taking myself off this earth (not that I still don’t think about it)

My parents are hoping that I might come around and say yes to the Indian societal acceptance of marriage. I am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum. We argue sometimes but more than that I feel MASSIVE guilt. Have I taken their happiness from them? Have I caused shame to my family for what I am? What if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? Should I just give up on life where I could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

All these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! I never had any friend that I could trust to tell them that I have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that I have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn’t help. I have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and I feel that hell is inside me.

I feel so alone and dejected in life. All I have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. All my life I adapted to not feel anything and do everything like I have been told. I get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. I have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

Honestly I thought I could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. I don’t have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that I am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. There is inherently something wrong with me and I can’t put my finger on it. Travelling is all I wanted to do. But all I can think of is how fucking ugly I am with absolutely no skills to boast for. Like being a useless log that lies in bed all day. 

If this is all there is I would rather pull the trigger soon after I make enough money to support my parents after I am gone. I have nothing to look forward to, life’s a drag and I don’t want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world.

Till class 8, I was good in studies. Then the first smartphone came into my house. My interest shifted to it. How android works, installing custom ROMs and all that stuff. Ruined class 9th. Back to track in class 10th. 89% in boards. Then in the meantime, I was interested in App Dev. At the end of 10th, I started learning some languages, but with no advice, I started with python for app dev. Studied KIVI lib but nothing useful in app dev. 

Then we were being taught C++ in school. So I started learning Android Studio with Kotlin. Developed some small apps like calc and some other. Also started Youtubing. Then after exploring the field, I was all into AI/ML. I just started learning Pandas and Numpy.  Results: Class 11th ruined. But this was not alone. I joined a bad institute, wasted my money and left(long story). So I stopped everything

Class 12th again back on track. Just gave my 12th examination(PCM, CS)..expecting 85-90%. But the thing is, it doesn't matter at all.

I gave JEE Mains first attempt(without studying). Got 75 percentile. The thing was I never knew there would be so much chaos for colleges. I don't want to take a drop, because I don't think I  can focus on preparing for entrances. I mean it has been one year, staying away from what I love. Also, my parents don't want to.

So present scenario: 

Not filling JEE form for 2nd attempt is my big mistake. Registered for BITSAT. The problem is the 11th course. I am trying to do it, but it is like messing up my brain with so much to remember in one month. There are other entrances(COMEDK, VITEE) as well but all expensive private universities. There are good ones though, but my parents aren't satisfied with filling expensive forms CONSIDERING I am not even prepared. And it's not wrong.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",Policy/Economy

It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

Today I am planning to go to  gastroenterologist and have treatment. My sister is saying not to break the quarantine and wait till April 10. I can't sleep at night because of the pain. I cant imagine waiting till April 10.

Do I have to face any legal issues if I break the quarantine (in case my apartment neighbors compalains)?

Please suggest me what to do? Thanks.

I have booked appointment with doctor. I will be meeting with him at 6.30pm. thanks for all the suggestions.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

A wise friend told me that if you want to remain friends on WhatsApp then better not to discuss religion and politics. Maybe he was right.

Maybe this fake news shitstorm has truly blinded well educated individuals, for whom bigotry has become second nature now.

It could begin with people in WhatsApp groups reporting someone at a \*.gov.in for sharing a dissenting article that they deem fake news, but in the process blacklisting the sharer in the govt's eyes. This could then snowball into folks being rewarded for doing their patriotic duty when they snitch on critics of the BJP or Hindutva, possibly by doxxing them or carrying out similar town square rituals of violation.

Hear me out.,"I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

667,fvrv9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvrv9a/scientific_temper_vs_faith/,Scientific temper vs Faith,"The following is an excerpt from a 1988 article on ""How to do research, at the MIT AI Lab"" (Link to the full article given at the end of this post). The following excerpt is about how to read a research paper:

```
Read with a question in mind. ""How can I use this?"" ""Does this really do what the author claims?"" ""What if...?"" 
```

The above, is what scientific temper is all about. It gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything. This has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers - to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself, until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper. No matter how successful/popular the author of the paper is, no matter how well cited a paper is, don't trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself - either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code, doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself.

A scientific temper teaches you to question everyone - from your parents, then your teachers, to your Governments. 

The reason this is not easy, is because it requires you to have an ego big enough to say ""everything is wrong until I verify it"" and simultaneously a humility big enough to say ""I was wrong"" when a mistake is pointed out. 

In the political scenario, you have Governments and followers indulging in fear-mongering to keep people in tow. You see fake videos spreading hatred and phobia that are easily debunked. You see Governments telling you that there are terror elements that intend to destroy the country - while a simple database lookup will show that on average, annually, less than 60 people die from cross-border terrorism of all kinds in India. 

Option 1, is to blindly believe anything your Government says. Option 2, is to put a lot of effort into investigating it yourself. 

Option 1 is about having faith, akin to following a religion. Its about clapping and lighting candles, while having blind faith that everything will be alright, no questions asked. Its about mindlessly chanting ""All is Well"" as portrayed in that (ironically) idiotic movie.
This option, leads to a faith based Governance - do nothing, have faith in us. 

Option 2 is about seeking the truth for yourself by exploration and collecting your own data samples. Its about being constantly updated and asking, rather nagging them, with questions like ""when will a mass testing program begin?"". 
This option, leads to people-driven Governance where we hold the decision-making power at every step of the way and the government only holds tools to execute those decisions.

More power to you, me, everyone.

We would have benefited if he told us to do something which was worth it but he is still keen on running a clown show despite then seriousness of the issue in hand. 

His charisma and command over people has me worried that this could be turned into a dictatorship really soon. We are one disaster away to be going towards that direction, even COVID-19 could be the disaster that leads to it.

One life is the personal one, and the other they think they and everyone around is supposed to live (but the fact that they don't live it and are ignorant of it). I'll give you some examples of it. 
1) In between these ""QUARANTIMES"", we see people on social media arguing about who is wrong and who is right for every step that govt takes, and therefore they split people into two groups (National and Anti-national). Instead of thinking about the notion of a simple idea like torching lights, they fight over and make jokes about the people who won't do it and to the extent of bullying them. They act as if they care so much about the nation that they won't let that person become anti-nationalist, change his thinking and be a help for the country. Mind it, it's all happening on the social media, but in the real-life you'll see the same set of people breaking the rules, throwing away garbage here and there, when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a "" kya fark padta hai"" attitude. Do they do this just because they want to show other people?
2) I am a student at a premier institute. Most of my classmates live a double life when it comes to academics. When there is an argument over why our education system is not productive, each and everyone will start suggesting how the institute doesn't provide excellent teaching, and profs are boring, etc. But when it comes to them, they won't give any second thought about playing games in the class, bunking them, even indulge in cheating almost every time if they are left unattended.

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor.

Those of us who feel this way should just stop participating in or even addressing these theatrics and as a bonus, plan and execute our own small scale activities. Activities which will keep the sheeple indoors, out of trouble and prevent them from spreading misinformation or anything. The fact that much of the country doesn't give a damn about what the PM or any other influential person or celebrity says should be enough to shut them up and make them focus solely on the pandemic. 
They don't know what it's like to see our neighbours, relatives and friends do dangerously stupid things during a crisis. They won't have to deal with the fallout. The media won't stop addressing this shit, the celebrities will keep spreading nonsensical things and other bad things will continue to happen. 
I think what we, as responsible and sane citizens, should do is this:

1) Just follow the WHO and govt guidelines regarding safety and health. 
2) Stop addressing anything the govt, the celebrities or any influencers say that doesn't focus on facts or logical steps regarding the covid-19 situation. Don't address any gestures or encouraging words from them. 
3) Come up with fun activities to engage yourselves and your neighbours to save them from participating in mindless behaviour. 

Even if small pockets of our population do this instead of submitting to whatever our leaders push on us, it'll be a victory. When we look back on this period of crisis, I don't want to see these influencers labelled as heroes and saviours. I don't want to see the glorification and rationalisation of these dumb acts. 

I want to see the stories of frontline soldiers and those few citizens who refused to be led into idiotic acts, who defied the system, who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the survival our their community and their sanity. 
Our leaders don't represent us. We are smart and sophisticated. History should remember how the citizens were the ones who kept the nation alive and kicking.

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",Policy/Economy

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

Also folks telling me this is a low effort post - I put more effort than the Prime Minister and I am not even elected by you. 

And folks speaking about the strong leadership of Marendra Nodi - The over centralisation of his government has resulted in one very incapable man doing a lot of stupid things hurting a lot of people. He is a Narcissist and doesn't care about people. At the same time there is a distinct lack of ideas at the center.",Politics

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.
